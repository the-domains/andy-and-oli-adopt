At home, we both enjoy cooking a variety of flavorful, health-conscious cuisines while our favorite tunes play in the background. And somehow, we always find new projects to work on whether they are functional or artistic. We really make an effort to appreciate the value of home while looking to the life outside for adventures.

With anticipation we wait for the day that we can share with our child how "The Outdoors" plays a big role in our lives as we love exploring our world's beautiful sceneries. Scuba diving in warm waters, teaching our child how to strap themselves into their first set of skis and/or snowboard in the mountains, or hiking coastal bluffs to catch a magnificent sunset is all part of the experience. Sitting around a bonfire with our family, telling ghosts stories in hopes of giving kids the goosies, is a highlight we enjoy when camping.

Andrew's work in the world of theater inspires us to be patrons of the arts. Musical Theater and Dance Performances are our top billings anywhere especially when visiting Oliver's family in Europe. Not only do we adore the variety of stage and sound but visiting local museums also enriches our experience when traveling to far away places, as well as to local sites.
