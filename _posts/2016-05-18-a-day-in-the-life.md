Living in our apartment that overlooks the beach, yet is walking distance to downtown, our weekend starts off with breakfast enjoyed on the balcony feeling the warm summer breeze and admiring our hummingbird friends. We look forward to building sandcastles and getting our feet wet with our little one, for an afternoon adventure, before strolling around to take advantage of the many parks, coffee shops, and local businesses while the baby naps in the stroller. As we walk back home, we pass a large playground and imagine the day our child is able to join the many kids in their laughter and play.'

Long Beach is an amazingly diverse city with a vibrant community, and we love being a part of it. Living in our apartment that overlooks the beach, yet is walking distance to downtown, our weekend starts off with breakfast enjoyed on the balcony feeling the warm summer breeze and admiring our hummingbird friends. We look forward to building sandcastles and getting our feet wet with our little one, for an afternoon adventure, before strolling around to take advantage of the many parks, coffee shops, and local businesses while the baby naps in the stroller. As we walk back home, we pass a large playground and imagine the day our child is able to join the many kids in their laughter and play.

At home, while we prepare dinner with the produce we just bought at the farmer's market, we look over to the dining/living room area and visualize one of us tending to the child, the other cooking, sharing with each other our favorite moments of the day.

Before bed, we foresee snuggling up and reading our child's favorite book for the 90th time and singing a lullaby to close out the day.
