![Meet Andrew:](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b8b72912395918110251acbae2504dd061333af5.jpg)

When I met Andrew, I instantly admired his inner strength: his strong sense of self balanced by his deep compassion for all people. A quality I know he will pass on to our child.

Andrew graduated with a BA in Dance from CalState Long Beach in 2010 and dance is still a major thread in his professional life. Theater being his professional realm, he works part-time as an Assistant Technical Director at local theaters and as a part time Costume Designer out of our home. His work mostly takes place evenings and weekends, this allows him to be at home during the day once our bundle of joy arrives. He can't wait to teach our little one his first dance steps, even before they can walk. Andrew loves to paint and draw, something that will come in handy when doing art projects with our child during playtime. He also values communication, a key ingredient for parenting, our relationship, and our friends and families. I adore his passion for love, life and his ability to make me laugh from the deepest part of my soul, something that renews my love for him daily.
