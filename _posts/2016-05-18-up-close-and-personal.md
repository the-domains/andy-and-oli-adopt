It is one thing to feel lucky to be able to call this man my husband, but it is amazing to be constantly reassured when I hear from friends and family that having Oliver in their lives is considered a blessing as well. He carries a calm, fluid energy that is both beautiful and a powerful grounding agent, especially for me. I look at him and see a foxy, well-put-together man with a radiant soul and dazzling personality (when he's not put on the spot). And his silliness and humor, polished in Vienna, Austria while achieving his degree in Theatre keeps me laughing in ways no one else can.

Picturing him as a dad is not difficult. His job at a Major Film Studio has a specialized title and helps him be the strong "provider" he likes to be. Any opportunity he has with children of friends and family displays his amazingly playful interactions and highlights his ability to appropriately speak with children. As our child grows, I see Oliver's diligent and organized manner manifesting a healthy sense of responsibility to the child's self as well as to those around. Especially because Oliver is a politically aware individual that likes to promote mindful understandings of our society and the importance of speaking up. All of these traits, I view as strengths and admire that he carries them so well and presents them invitingly.
