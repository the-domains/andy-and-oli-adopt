One thing is for sure, there is no shortage of loving relatives as Andrew's "Big Mexican Family" all live within a 2 hour drive. Once a month our aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews all gather to celebrate the birthdays of that month. Since beginning our adoption journey, everyone excitingly shares how they cannot wait for us to add a new family member to these events. We've even heard the aunts debate who will take the title of "Best Babysitter". One says she has the best technique to pottie train, another wants to be swimming coach, a few will teach sign language and all agree to teach Spanish and instill good manners. Although, Grandma Maye says there's no way any of her sisters will upstage her plans to be the favorite. 

And even though Oliver's family is in Europe, likewise, they are thrilled to welcome our first child as soon as we can visit. Annalena and Florin (Oliver's sister and Godson in Zurich, Switzerland) eagerly anticipate our child's visits when they get to explore the Alps together. The remaining aunts, uncles and cousins plan on cultivating our child's understanding and experience of German folklore and culture in ways such as singing German folk songs. Of course, we will appreciate what our families share of our cultural backgrounds, but we will also be ambitious in exploring and sharing with them any of our child's ethnic roots.
