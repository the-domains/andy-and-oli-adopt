You know those couples you see in public gushing over some stranger's baby, looking like they're about to burst at the seams? That's us! Now imagine this is your baby we're fawning over!

**It All Starts with Hello:**There are plenty of emotions that come with the decision of placing your baby that we cannot begin to understand, but we are thrilled that you would take the time to read our letter and consider us. Hopefully, we get the opportunity to learn about you and the dreams you have for your baby.
