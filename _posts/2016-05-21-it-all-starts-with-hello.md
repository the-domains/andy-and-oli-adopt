## You know those couples you see in public gushing over some stranger's baby, looking like they're about to burst at the seams? That's us! Now imagine this is your baby we're fawning over!

## **It All Starts with Hello:**There are plenty of emotions that come with the decision of placing your baby that we cannot begin to understand, but we are thrilled that you would take the time to read our letter and consider us. Hopefully, we get the opportunity to learn about you and the dreams you have for your baby.

# **"Us" in a Nutshell**

## About the way we met, we like to say, "There's an App for that!" After a month of online discussions, we had our first date in 2011\. With our immediate families by our side, we were married at sunset atop a beautiful, seaside cliff in Palos Verdes, California in August 2013\.

Andrew is a first generation American of Mexican decent, and is strongly connected to his "big Mexican family". Oliver, adopted by a large family of his own, was born and raised in Germany. When we imagined having children, adoption was the most obvious path. After reflecting on Oliver's closed adoption, we recognized an opportunity to provide a positive experience through open adoption, especially because we would like to incorporate our birthmother as part of our extended family to travel down this path of love.

# **A Day in the Life**

## Long Beach is an amazingly diverse city with a vibrant community. Living in our apartment that overlooks the beach, our weekend starts off with breakfast enjoyed on the balcony feeling the warm summer breeze. We look forward to building sandcastles and getting our feet wet with our little one before strolling around to take advantage of the many parks, coffee shops, and local businesses while the baby naps in the stroller. As we walk back home, we pass a large playground and imagine the day our child is able to join the many kids in their laughter and play.

At home, while we prepare dinner, we look over to the dining-living room area and visualize one of us tending to our child, the other cooking, sharing with each other our favorite moments of the day. Before bed, we foresee snuggling up and reading our child's favorite book for the ninetieth time and singing a lullaby to close out the day.
