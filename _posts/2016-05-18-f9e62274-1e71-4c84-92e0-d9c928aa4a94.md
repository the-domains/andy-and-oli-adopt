About the way we met, we like to say, "There's an App for that!" After a month of online discussions, we had our first date in 2011\. Very early on we recognized our shared values and aspirations to get married and create a family. With our immediate families by our side, we were married at sunset atop a beautiful, seaside cliff in Palos Verdes, California in August 2013\.

Andrew is a 1st generation American of Mexican decent, and is strongly connected to his "big Mexican family". Oliver, adopted by a large family of his own, was born and raised in Germany. When we imagined having children, adoption was the most obvious path. After reflecting on Oliver's closed adoption, we recognized an opportunity to provide a positive experience through open adoption... especially because we would like to incorporate our birthmother as part of our extended family. With the help of our family and the commitment we have to open communication, we look forward to traveling down this path of love.
